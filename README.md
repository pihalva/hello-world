I am really passionate about fighting criminal organizations that perform online, it excites me and makes me feel like a detective.

My strengths and values can be applied to learn as much as I can about cybersecurity

Draft a two- to three-sentence professional statement that includes details about your strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity, as well as how they can support the security goals of various organizations.
Ejemplo:
I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike.
